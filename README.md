# go-plaid
[Plaid](https://plaid.com//) is a safe way for apps to connect to financial accounts. To understand what they can offer better, this is a toy app to demonstrate some features of plaid APIs. Of course what `Plaid` can provide is way more than what are demonstrated here but hopefully this app could give you a sense about their business ambitions.

# plaid API features to demostrate
- [x] plaid link to allow user to log in their bank account safely
- [x] account operations such as checking account balance after successful authentication
